# Simple Go gRPC service

Simple Go gRPC service to discover and demonstrate best practices.
The service is based on the standard Go project layout: https://github.com/golang-standards/project-layout

Welcome to contribute, suggest and discuss improvements.

The service provides basic authentication and user management.

It is a client application for testing the service:

Audit logging can be based on a separate Time table or simple created_at/updated_at fields.
Let's leave the implementation out of scope for now, although you are welcome to discuss it as well.
